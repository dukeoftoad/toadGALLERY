All notable changes to toadGALLERY are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions track
`versionName` in `apps/gallery/build.gradle.kts` (pre-1.0 alphas).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- CI no longer runs emulator-based instrumented tests at all: the workflow is
  compile + lint + JVM unit tests only (ADR-0016). The instrumented privacy
  egress suite stays in `src/androidTest` as a manual on-device release gate.

## [0.3.3-alpha] — unreleased on main (versionCode 7)

### Added

- Aspect-ratio-aware staggered media grid; video duration overlay; GIF play
  indicator (#33, #34 — PR #37).
- Paging 3 incremental timeline windows + load-state layering (#28 — PR #37).
  (The paging slice was internally tagged 0.3.2-alpha on its branch; it
  shipped as part of 0.3.3.)
- MediaStore change observation wired to paging invalidation, append
  load-state footer, idempotent permission re-entry, Ready-state test tags
  (#38 — PR #40).
- Screen-state system: Loading / Error / Unsupported-file layouts,
  permission-denied state with a Settings deep-link, per-state test tags
  (#13 — PR #41).
- System Photo Picker alternative path: Settings toggle, `ACTION_PICK_IMAGES`
  flow on API 33+, picked-photos browsing view (#27 — PR #42).

### Changed

- CI: retry + /data-exhaustion hardening rounds for the (now removed) emulator
  privacy job (PRs #39, #43) — final scope decision in ADR-0016.

## [0.3.1-alpha] — 2026-10-30

### Added

- Albums tab: folder grid, album detail view, shared media UI pieces
  (#29 — PR #35).

## [0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Added

- Photos tab: MediaStore-backed timeline, `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` /
  `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` permission flow (legacy `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` capped at
  API 32), four-tab shell (Photos / Albums / Search / Settings)
  (#25 — PR #26).

## [0.2.1-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Security

- Privacy gate, offline by construction (ADR-0014): build-time
  merged-manifest INTERNET permission gate with allowlist protocol,
  `PrivacyPolicyTest` JVM tripwires, instrumented egress suite (#20 — PR #23).

## [0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Changed

- v2.2 product re-frame: features/UI/UX/designs only from upstreams, Kotlin +
  Jetpack Compose, no Flutter, GitHub Actions CI; Compose-native app shell —
  Compose toolchain, NavHost migration, removal of `org.fossify:commons`
  (#16, #17, #18, #19).

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Added

- Phase 2 exit: first product APK — app shell, Material 3 theme, offline
  posture (no INTERNET permission in the manifest), CI workflow (#15).
