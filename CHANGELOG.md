## [0.4.0-alpha] — unreleased on main (versionCode 8)

### Added

- Hidden vault storage + unlock UI (#32, slice 2/2, on the ADR-0017 core): the
  vault is now a complete feature. `VaultStore` (pure JVM) keeps the sealed PIN
  record, a sealed hand-rolled index (`VaultIndex`, strict parsing, escaped
  display names) and id-named sealed blobs under app-private storage — blob
  first, index second (crash orphans are reclaimed by the unlock sweep, never a
  dangling index entry); small files go through tmp+rename atomic writes.
  `AndroidVaultKeys` supplies the non-exportable AES-256-GCM AndroidKeyStore key
  (StrongBox when the device has it, TEE fallback). Setup/unlock run PBKDF2 on
  `Dispatchers.Default`; the unlock session is in-memory only and auto-locks on
  background (`ON_STOP`, shell lifecycle observer). "Move to vault" appears in
  the Photos selection app bar once the vault is configured: bytes are streamed
  through the sealing cipher, then the originals are removed through the #30
  consent machinery (one `createDeleteRequest` per batch); restore is the
  inverse pending-insert flow, deleting the blob only after the row publishes.
  The new `vault` sub-screen (Settings entry, status line leaks nothing while
  locked) offers setup with the no-recovery trade-off stated verbatim, unlock,
  restore, and confirmed permanent delete. 39 new JVM tests pin the store
  (round-trip, tamper/truncation, orphan sweep, wipe, wrong-key rejection) and
  the index format.
- Vault crypto core (#32, ADR-0017): pure-JVM `VaultCrypto` — PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
  PIN digests (210k rounds, constant-time verify, wipable `CharArray` input) and
  AES-256-GCM sealing (`IV(12) || ciphertext || tag(128)`, fresh IV per seal) with
  streaming seal/open for vault media beyond heap size; key delivered through the
  `VaultKeyProvider` seam (production: non-exportable AndroidKeyStore key, later
  slice). 13 JVM tests pin round-trip, wrong-key/tamper/truncation rejection, IV
  uniqueness and a 5 MiB streaming round-trip.
- Recycle bin (#31): deletion on the Photos timeline now routes to
  MediaStore's system trash on API 30+ (`createTrashRequest` consent flow,
  one request per batch; rows stay recoverable ~30 days with system-managed
  auto-purge), while Android 10 keeps the permanent-delete path (no trash
  protocol exists below R). New `trash` sub-screen reached from a Settings
  entry (live item count + total size, `DataSizeFormats`): restore or
  delete-permanently any selection, or empty everything — each via one
  consent request, narrated with honest snackbars. `TO_TRASH` seam from #30
  is now the delete default; JVM tests pin the size formatter; lint is a
  hard CI gate (see Changed).
- Full-screen media viewer (#50 — PR #51): tapping a grid cell on the Photos
  timeline or in album detail (outside selection mode) now opens the viewer —
  black edge-to-edge canvas with hidden system bars, a `HorizontalPager` over
  the tap-time window, photos full-fit via Coil, and in-app video playback
  through media3 ExoPlayer 1.11.1 (local content URIs only; roadmap L608).
  Chrome bar with back action + "n of m" counter; honest playback-error copy
  when the device codec can't decode the file; video grid cells that fail
  frame extraction (`getFrameAtTime` NULL on some device codecs) now show an
  `ic_video_fallback` poster instead of a blank cell. Window hand-off via a
  shell-scoped `ViewerViewModel` (the #27 pattern); JVM tests pin the
  `ViewerWindow` clamping contract. Pinch-zoom/pan and animated GIF playback
  are deferred (see issue #50).
- File operations on the Photos timeline (#30 — PR #48): rename (extension
  preserved), in-place copy (` (copy)` naming with collision numbering),
  move (copy→delete with per-item results), delete (permanent v1, explicit
  confirmation); long-press multi-select with a selection app bar, album
  picker, undo snackbars for rename/copy/move, cancellable >5-item batch
  progress, and one aggregated `createWriteRequest`/`createDeleteRequest`
  consent dialog for entries the app does not own (API 29+; ops hidden on
  older APIs). MediaStore-only, URI-first (ADR-0006); `DeleteMode.TO_TRASH`
  seam reserved for the recycle bin (#31).
- Design tokens & theme (#11 — PR #47): spacing/shape/elevation/motion/
  touch-target token system, full 15-role M3 typography, explicit light+dark
  fallback palettes (MI-inspired warm grays + single green accent, WCAG AA
  pairs computed), dynamic color kept on API 31+, edge-to-edge, and the four
  state components migrated to tokens. JVM test pins the scale invariants.

### Changed

- Lint is a hard CI gate (#52): the 19 pre-existing NewApi errors from the
  file-ops slice are resolved (documented `@Suppress("NewApi")` on the
  Q-guard invariant; `@RequiresApi(R)` on the consent builders) and
  `continue-on-error` removed from the lint step.
- CI runs compile + JVM unit tests only — no emulator-based tests (ADR-0016,
  PR #45); the instrumented privacy suite is a manual on-device release gate.
- Docs (#21, #22 — PR #46): `androidphotofilters` and `jxl-coder-glide`
  marked DROPPED per ADR-0008; risk register updated (R-10 downgraded, R-14
  closed, R-16/R-17/R-18 added).

## [0.3.3-alpha] — unreleased on main (versionCode 7)

### Added

- Aspect-ratio-aware staggered media grid; video duration overlay; GIF play
  indicator (#33, #34 — PR #37).
- Paging 3 incremental timeline windows + load-state layering (#28 — PR #37).
  (The paging slice was internally tagged 0.3.2-alpha on its branch; it
  shipped as part of 0.3.3.)
- MediaStore change observation wired to paging invalidation, append
  load-state footer, idempotent permission re-entry, Ready-state test tags
  (#38 — PR #40).
- Screen-state system: Loading / Error / Unsupported-file layouts,
  permission-denied state with a Settings deep-link, per-state test tags
  (#13 — PR #41).
- System Photo Picker alternative path: Settings toggle, `ACTION_PICK_IMAGES`
  flow on API 33+, picked-photos browsing view (#27 — PR #42).

### Changed

- CI: retry + /data-exhaustion hardening rounds for the (now removed) emulator
  privacy job (PRs #39, #43) — final scope decision in ADR-0016.

## [0.3.1-alpha] — 2026-10-30

### Added

- Albums tab: folder grid, album detail view, shared media UI pieces
  (#29 — PR #35).

## [0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Added

- Photos tab: MediaStore-backed timeline, `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` /
  `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` permission flow (legacy `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` capped at
  API 32), four-tab shell (Photos / Albums / Search / Settings)
  (#25 — PR #26).

## [0.2.1-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Security

- Privacy gate, offline by construction (ADR-0014): build-time
  merged-manifest INTERNET permission gate with allowlist protocol,
  `PrivacyPolicyTest` JVM tripwires, instrumented egress suite (#20 — PR #23).

## [0.2.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Changed

- v2.2 product re-frame: features/UI/UX/designs only from upstreams, Kotlin +
  Jetpack Compose, no Flutter, GitHub Actions CI; Compose-native app shell —
  Compose toolchain, NavHost migration, removal of `org.fossify:commons`
  (#16, #17, #18, #19).

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-10-29

### Added

- Phase 2 exit: first product APK — app shell, Material 3 theme, offline
  posture (no INTERNET permission in the manifest), CI workflow (#15).
